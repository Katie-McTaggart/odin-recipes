# odin-recipes

This is to create a collection of inter linked recipe webpages that also link to the web. They will have pictures, headings, and emphasized text.

Thus I will practice:

- Boilerplates
- Lists
- Linking sites
- Images
- Strong (bold) text
- Emphasized (italicized) text
- Paragraphs
- Headings
